# Introduction
--

### Repeated Measures ANOVA

--

- Analysis of Variance for related groups

--

- Data will often have multiple measures for 1 participant across different timepoints

--

### Data Formats Possible

--

- Wide Format --> Each indiviudal subject is contained per row, with the variable measures displayed in individual columns

--

- Long Format --> Each individual measure is contained per column, with the same subject appearing in multiple rows

---

# Data Preparation is Key

### Most classes teach data prep as part of a statisitcs course

--

Important Factors we are taught to review:

--

1. Kurtosis (Is it flat?!)

--

1. Skew (To the left now y'all!)

--

1. Missingness (where'd it go?)

--

1. Outliers (That number reads as what?!)

--

### We should add another: DATA FORMAT!

# Packages Available to Reshape Data



.pull-left[

Reshape2

1. reshape()

1. melt()

1. reshapelong()

1. reshapewide()

]



.pull-right[

Reshape

1. cast()

1. reshape1()

]


Tools exists to ensure that we have the most flexibility to arrange and re-arrange our data seamlessly*



.footnote[[*]- seamlessly is probably a BIT of a hyperbole. It takes some work.]

# "Shaping" Data - 1

### Resphape 2--Data into Wide Format 

--

Reshape2 package helps users with the transformation of data from either the long format to the wide format or the wide format to the long format.

1. reshape(dataframe, dependent variable names, independent variable name, variable in long format differentiates multiple records from the same group, wide format or long format)


```{r}

wide <- reshape(Indometh, v.names = "conc", idvar = "Subject",
                timevar = "time", direction = "wide")

wide

```

---

# "Shaping" Data - 2

--

### Reshape2-- Data into Long Format 

--
2. reshape(dataframe, dependent variable names, independent variable name, variable in long format differentiates multiple records from the same group, wide format or long format)

```{r}
state.x77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
long <- reshape(state.x77, idvar = "state", ids = row.names(state.x77),
                times = names(state.x77), timevar = "Characteristic",
                varying = list(names(state.x77)), direction = "long")

long[,-1]
```
---
background-size: contain 

# "Shaping" Data - 3 

--

### Melt-- data into long format 

--

3. melt(dataframe, Subject Name Code Column, Variable Column Names in list form)

```{r, message=FALSE} 
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
SubjectID<-1:50
df<-data.frame(SubjectID,state.x77)
example<-melt(df,id="SubjectID")
ex<-example%>%filter(SubjectID==1)
ex
```

# Why Change Formats?

---

# Software Analysis

Packages like EZANOVA or even the summary_aov function in R require that the data be set up in certain ways prior to analyzing


.pull-left[
EZANOVA
1. Requires Data to be in "Long" Format

1. Will still run on Wide Format but gives incorrect Results

1. Does not give an input data error

]

.pull-right[
Summary_AOV
1. Requires Data to be in "Long" Format

1. Will still run on Wide Format but gives incorrect Results

1. Does not give an input data error
]

.footnote[ It really is important to understand what data input is needed prior to pushing data through the programs.]
